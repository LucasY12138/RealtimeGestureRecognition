# Real-time Event-base camera gesture recognition system

## Description
It is a capstone project about using Spiking Neuro Networks and Dynamic Vision Sensor to implement real-time gesture recognition.
This project using Spikingjelly framework to train SNNs model. For detail information, pls review the following official website: https://spikingjelly.readthedocs.io/zh-cn/latest/activation_based/classify_dvsg.html
