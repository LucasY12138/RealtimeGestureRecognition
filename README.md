# Real-time Event-base camera gesture recognition system

## Description
It is a capstone project about using Spiking Neuro Networks and Dynamic Vision Sensor to implement real-time gesture recognition.
This project using Spikingjelly framework to train SNNs model. For detail information, pls review the following official website: https://spikingjelly.readthedocs.io/zh-cn/latest/activation_based/classify_dvsg.html

## Matters need Attentions
This project must be connected to the Dynamic Vision Sensor to run.

## Installation

### Clone the Project
Clone the project repository by running the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/LucasY12138/RealtimeGestureRecognition.git
```

### Find "camera10.py"
Locate the "camera10.py" file within the cloned project.

### Install Required Libraries

#### Install Python

#### PyTorch and torchvision
Ensure that PyTorch and torchvision are installed. If not, you can install them using the following command:
```
pip install torch torchvision
```

#### dv_processing
Install dv_processing library by running the following command:
```
pip install dv_processing
```

#### cv2 (OpenCV)
Install cv2 (OpenCV) library by running the following command:
```
pip install opencv-python
```

## Usage
After installed related libraries, just click the run/play button in the camera10.py, which is located VS code right top.
You also are allowed to run it in terminal:
1, cd the directory
2, python camera10.py
